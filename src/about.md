I am a PhD student in Computer Science at Cornell University where I'm advised by <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jnfoster/">Nate Foster</a>. My research focuses on the design and implementation of programming languages for networked systems.

I was previously a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research India, and before that I received my bachelor's and master's in Computer Science from IIT Delhi.
